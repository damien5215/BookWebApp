# BookWebApp: ASP.NET, MVC, CRUD web app with EF database (code-first).

This app is adapted from a Treehouse project - 
https://github.com/treehouse-projects/dotnet-comic-book-library-manager

I adapted it for books (Fiction/Non-Fiction) rather than comicbooks.

It contains a CRUD console app and a CRUD web app. The two projects share the class files via a class library.

Adapting the project taught me more about Entity Framework 6, Connection Strings, Database Initializers, LINQ statements, CRUD functionality, Dispose Method, etc.
